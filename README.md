This repository demonstrates how to build reusable **SQL views** to simplify complex `SELECT` queries and enable **data abstraction**.

## 📂 What’s included?

- ✅ SQL scripts to:
  - Create `Customers`, `Orders`, and `Payments` tables.
  - Insert sample data.
  - Run multiple practice SQL queries.
  - Create a **VIEW** with a multi-table `JOIN`.
  - Use the view for simple, clean queries.

## 🎯 Key Concepts

- Using **views** to hide table joins and filters.
- Simplify frequent queries.
- Control what data is exposed to users.

## ⚙️ Tools

- Oracle SQL*Plus  
- Compatible with MySQL / SQLite (with minor tweaks).

**🚀 Ready to test, practice, and reuse!**
